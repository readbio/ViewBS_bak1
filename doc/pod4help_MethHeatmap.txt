=head1 NAME

ViewBS MethHeatmap - Generate methylation for each region and each sample to
make heatmap.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ViewBS MethHeatmap
--region <region>
--sample <methlation information,sample_name> [--sample <methlation information,sample_name>]
--outdir <output folder>
--prefix <prefix for output file>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Onestop will help you process ChIP-seq data from the raw sequencde
data, including default deconseq step, cutadapt step and mapping step, as well
as calling peaks using SICER, calling diff-peaks using SICER-df. 

=head1 Required arguments

=over 8

=item B<-help> | B<-h>

 - Prints the help message and exists.

=item B<verbose>
   
 - Suppress extended information or not. [Default: TRUE]

=item B<region [required]>

 - regions you want to investigate. 

=item B<sample [required]>

 - Provide the sample information. [Format: methlationfile,samplename] 
   It is possible to specify more than one sample pair by using the options 
   --sample more than once. The methylation information can also be read from
   a TEXT file. Instead of giving an explicit sample information pairs, 
   you need to write file: followed by the name of the TEXT file.

=item B<minDepth [optional]>

 - Minimum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 5]

=item B<maxDepth [optional]>

 - Maximum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 10000]

=item B<cluster_cols [optional]>

 - boolean values determining if rows should be clustered or hclust object. 

=item B<cluster_cols [optional]>

 - boolean values determining if columns should be clustered or hclust object.

=item B<prefix [optional]>

 - Output folder. [Default: ./]

=item B<prefix [optional]>

 - Provide prefix for the output file. [Default: ]
