=head1 NAME

ViewBS MethOverRegion - Generate methylation information over a list of
regions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ViewBS MethOverRegion --region <region> 
--sample <meth,sample_name> [--sample <meth,sample_name> .......]
--prefix <prefix for output>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MethOverRegion will calculate DNA methylation information across the provide
regions, genes, transposable elements, etc. 

=head1 Required arguments

=over 8

=item B<-help> | B<-h>

 - Prints the help message and exists.

=item B<--verbose>
   
=item B<region [required]>

 - regions you want to investigate. 

=item B<sample [required]>

 - Provide the sample information. [Format: methlationfile,samplename] 
   It is possible to specify more than one sample pair by using the options 
   --sample more than once. The methylation information can also be read from
   a TEXT file. Instead of giving an explicit sample information pairs, 
   you need to write file: followed by the name of the TEXT file.

=item B<binNumber [optional]>

 - 

=item B<binNum [optional]>

 - .

=item B<minDepth [optional]>

 - Minimum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 5]

=item B<maxDepth [optional]>

 - Maximum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 400]

=item B<prefix [optional]>

 - Provide prefix for the output file.

=item B<RegionName [Optional]>

 - The type of regions provided, like Gene, TE, DMR, etc. [Default: Gene]
